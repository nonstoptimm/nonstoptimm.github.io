- Implemented training data generator for natural language understanding units to enhance recognition quality in specific domains

*open source projects*
- co-developed python-based end-to-end solution [verseagility](https://github.com/microsoft/verseagility) for custom natural language processing tasks including classification, named entity recognition, question-answering, summarization and machine reading comprehension. The toolkit helped to reduce implementation efforts to reach go-live stage by 60% within multiple customer engagements
- Developed solution accelerator [glue](https://github.com/microsoft/glue) for language-based use cases with azure cognitive services, enabling customers and developers to conduct end-to-end batch testing of interconnected services and models
- Co-created open source data labeling tool [uplabel](https://github.com/maknotavailable/uplabel), including active learning feature and labeler performance metrics to iteratively enhance data label quality for natural language processing use cases
